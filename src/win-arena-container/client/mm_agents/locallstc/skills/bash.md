# Skill: Bash Execution

- Use this skill when the task can be completed more reliably by editing files, transforming tabular data, or inspecting outputs from the shell.
- Output bash actions as bare shell/Python command strings in `actions`.
- Prefer one concise command or one short Python snippet that completes a meaningful chunk of work.
- Keep commands non-interactive.
- Before running a bash command, estimate whether its output could be large; if so, narrow the query with exact paths, filters, counts, or limits (for example `head`, `find ... -name`, or targeted `rg`) instead of dumping broad listings or full file contents.
- The target VM is Linux. Use Linux paths and Linux commands (`/home/user`, `find`, `sed`, `awk`, `cp`, `mv`, `zip`, `unzip`, `python3`), not macOS or Windows commands such as `osascript`, `/Users/...`, PowerShell, or Windows drive paths.
- The default user is `user`, so use `/home/user` instead of `~` when passing file paths into Python or other tools that may not expand the shell shorthand. If sudo is needed, the password is `password`.
- Common Python packages are preinstalled in the Linux guest before tasks start. Prefer using those preinstalled packages; if a task needs another Python package, add it to the default guest package list in the runner/setup code rather than repeatedly installing it during task execution. Do not assume non-Python system tools such as `xclip`, `xdotool`, `osascript`, or `gcloud` exist.
- Before editing any document, spreadsheet, or data file from bash, first locate the exact file path you will modify. Do not assume filenames or invent placeholder paths.
- Before modifying a file from bash, create a backup copy first so you can recover or compare if the edit goes wrong.
- Once the target file path is known, edit the file directly with a Python script or another file-editing command. Do not rely on GUI-only state, fake macro files, or format-conversion commands as a substitute for editing the real file.
- If bash has already written the target file successfully, do not perform an extra GUI `Save`, reopen, reload, or refresh step just to “make it stick” or make the stale window look updated; the file on disk is already updated, the application window may still show stale in-memory content, and verification should come from bash/file-level readback rather than the old screenshot.
- If bash has already failed on the current approach, do not keep retrying slight command variants. Reassess whether the shell path is still the safest option.

### Bash examples

```json
{
    "thought": "I need the exact workbook path before editing so the Python script modifies the real file rather than a guessed location.",
    "subgoal": "Locate the target workbook",
    "actions": ["find /home/user -type f \\( -name '*.ods' -o -name '*.xlsx' \\) 2>/dev/null | head -20"]
}
```

```json
{
    "thought": "Now that I know the workbook path, I can update the real file directly and save text-form values without relying on GUI state.",
    "subgoal": "Update the workbook data",
    "actions": ["python3 - <<'PY'\nfrom openpyxl import load_workbook\npath = '/home/user/example.xlsx'\nwb = load_workbook(path)\nws = wb.active\ncell = ws['A2']\ncell.value = 'text_value'\ncell.number_format = '@'\nwb.save(path)\nprint(path)\nPY"]
}
```
